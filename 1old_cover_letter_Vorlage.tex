As a student of computer science with extensive experience, I am interested in learning more about the application of computers in the xxx industry. Therefore I would like to apply for a position as an xxx in the xxx. The xx should be for a period of xx months starting in xxx.
\\~\\
I am a student at the Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt (technical University) in Ingolstadt, Germany where I have been studying since October 2012.
Before I began my studies at the University, I completed several internships in metal working, electronic engineering and software engineering. During this time I gained knowledge and practical experience in a wide range of different fields.
\\~\\
I have been interested in computers since I was seven years old. My current area of expertise is machine learning, programming languages and robotics. While my studies I worked as a software developer in the automotive industry at BMW and acquired know-how at several suppliers in Ingolstadt. My responsibilities included the reinforcement on autonomous driving. In addition to that I work as an independent software engineer in varying IT projects. 
\\~\\
At the Technische Hochschule I am a member and chairman of different communities and political representative of the student body of said University. In my free time I coach the Volleyball team and play the e-guitar in various bands. Working and interacting with people, team work, problem solving, and learning new things is what keeps me stimulated and engaged. I believe these qualifications, in addition to my positive outlook, will help your company attain its goals.
\\~\\
Due to my experience with the programming language C# for your project I perfectly match to your internship.
I would be happy to provide any additional information you require regarding my history.
I am available for a telephone or personal interview at your convenience and am looking forward to receiving your reply.
\\

Yours faithfully,
